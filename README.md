# Learn AR

### Augmented Reality Application to support education


This is a mobile application in Flutter based on Augmented Reality (AR), with the aim of enriching the educational experience of any student. The app was created during an academic internship at the Universit√† Politecnica delle Marche and was the subject of an experimental thesis. 

Augmented reality refers to the enrichment of human sensory perception through information, usually manipulated and conveyed electronically, that would not be perceivable
with the five senses. The integration of augmented reality with educational technologies is a step towards the goal of creating an interactive and engaging educational environment.
immersive educational environment.

Using Flutter, a versatile cross-platform development framework, the resulting application, called Learn AR, combines user experience with augmented reality.
This project goes beyond the boundaries associated with the traditional enjoyment of educational material to allow the student using it to visualise a complex object in such a way that it becomes real.

The case study chosen for the thesis is a book that deals with the architecture
of computers. Through this application students will be able to
visualise 3D models that enrich traditional texts and facilitate hands-on learning.
In the case of this application the 3D models of GPU, CPU and
RAM. The use of augmented reality makes complex concepts such as the structure of a
a GPU, more understandable.

This case study was chosen to demonstrate the effectiveness of an innovative educational approach that combines theoretical and practical content with a single training tool.

The Learn AR application will offer the following main functionalities:
- **AR markers**: specific pages of the book will contain markers that, framed with the application, will allow to visualize 3D models related
to the contents of the page.

- **Visualisation of 3D models**: Users will be able to explore three-dimensional representations of hardware components.
  
- **Interaction with 3D Models**: Users will be able to interact with 3D models, e.g. by rotating, enlarging or exploring them in detail to better understand different parts and their function.
in detail to better understand the different parts and their functioning.

- **Quizzes**: the application will contain interactive quizzes to test users' understanding and reinforce learning.
